# -DeeperTask

This is a Deeper Task repo.

In order to accomplish this task my approach was to use a CNN in Keras to predict image orientation, then use OpenCV to fix image orientation error.

To execute the code simply run mkdir.py to separate labels into a dir, then run CNN.py in oder to creade and train a model. Finily run a validation.py to make CSV file and correct image orientation.
